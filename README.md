# BreedPic

BreedPic is an iOS app which aims to display pictures of dogs of different breeds. Currently Work in progress.

This is a learning experience for me as I entered the iOS development world by mantaining a couple of apps which were MVC (Massive view controller), spaghetti code all over the place, so what I'm learning here is:

- MVVM, model view viewmodel as architecture
- Alamofire routers instead of old and massive networking singletons (some "Single responsibility principle")
- Google sign-in to counter the lack of a backend of my own
- JSON decoding with Codable protocol
- Generic function creation whenever possible and necessary
- Overall best practices

It has cocoapods enabled, and uses Alamofire under the hood for HTTP networking

I'm using the Dog API: https://dog.ceo/api, a project which can be found at https://github.com/ElliottLandsborough/dog-ceo-api.

### Footnote
As I go along, I'll be updating both the project, as well as this file to keep up with latest results, objectives, etc.
