# BreedPic

At the moment an iOS app which displays nothing but a white screen.

It has cocoapods enabled, and is now using Alamofire for HTTP networking

I've recently added a Router with Alamofire's URLRequestConvertible, to perform calls to https://dog.ceo/api, a project which can be found at https://github.com/ElliottLandsborough/dog-ceo-api

As I go along, I'll be updating both the project, as well as this file to keep up with latest results, objectives, etc.
